Welcome to the official website of the Reformational Philosophy and Ethics of Technology (RPET) group. Our mission is to explore the intersection of philosophy, ethics, and technology, fostering discussions that promote a deeper understanding of how technology impacts society and individual lives.

## About Us

The RPET group is dedicated to examining the philosophical foundations of technology and its ethical implications. We aim to engage scholars, practitioners, and the public in meaningful conversations about the role of technology in shaping our world. Through research, discussions, and collaborative projects, we strive to contribute to a more thoughtful and responsible approach to technological development and implementation.

Join us as we navigate the complexities of technology through a reformational lens, seeking to align technological advancements with ethical principles and societal well-being.
